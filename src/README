Hello dear managers of JavaRush Project.

Let me thanks you for such great project. I currently learn level 39 of your course.

But I find it more important to take part in project. Those version of my test task which deployed on GIT HUB is not perfect and have some bugs
 due to my misunderstanding of possibility to bind view with controller. I'm very tired make attempts which cannot be solved,
  so maybe you will help me. It's very difficult to combine many new technologies to do this task in two weeks.

 I payed training courses in advance and have a strong will to learn by your method as did is so far. But it's easier previously learn
 material and then make tasks :) So I hope you would dive me opportunity to take part in project :)


 With best regards Roman Demkiv :)
